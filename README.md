# Proteomics Quantification and Quality Control Pipeline

This **Snakemake** pipeline enables proteomics researchers to **quantify large-cohort DIA mass spectrometry data** and **automatically generate a quality control (QC) report in PDF format**. It supports both **DIA-NN** and **Spectronaut** quantification strategies, and is designed to be modular, robust, and user-friendlyâ€”even for those new to Snakemake.

## Installation

Clone the repository into your server's directory:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nigelkurgan/snakepro.git
```

Install Snakemake (version 9.9.0 or compatible):

```bash
conda create -n snakemake -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakemake
conda activate snakemake
```

---

## Configuration

Edit the **config/config.yml** file with the appropriate paths and options.  
**Example:**

```yaml
# Tool selection
quant_tool: diann          # "diann" or "spectronaut"
run_mode: cohort           # "cohort", "workflow", or "all"
run_qc: true               # enable QC report generation
sn_batch_correct: false    # Spectronaut-specific flag

# Paths
project_root: '/path/to/pipeline/'
metadata: 'data_input/ms_raw_files.csv'
fasta_file: 'data_input/uniprot_reference.fa'

# QC settings
filtering_option: all       # "all" or "group"
group: null                 # required if filtering_option: group
filtering_percentage: 0.20
missing_values_grouping: 'condition'
pca_factors: ["plate", "condition", "time"]
contamination_panel: true
contamination_panel_file: 'data_input/contamination_panel.xlsx'
exclude_samples: []         # e.g. ["sample_001", "sample_042"]
batch_correction: false
batch_effect_column: "plate"
```

**Key parameters:**
- `quant_tool`: Choose `"diann"` or `"spectronaut"` for quantification.
- `run_mode`: Controls how quantification is performed:
    - `"cohort"`: Per workflow and cohort (default).
    - `"workflow"`: Per workflow (all cohorts pooled).
    - `"all"`: All samples pooled together.
- `run_qc`: If `true`, generates QC reports.
- `exclude_samples`: List of samples to exclude from analysis.
- `batch_correction`: Enable/disable batch correction.

## Input Data Preparation

1. **Raw data files**  
   Place your raw files (e.g., Thermo `.raw`, Bruker `.d` folders) in:
   ```
   data_input/raw_files/
   ```
   Example upload command:
   ```bash
   scp -r {directory}/raw_files user@server:/path/to/pipeline/data_input/raw_files/
   ```

2. **FASTA file and metadata**  
   Place your reference FASTA and metadata CSV in:
   ```
   data_input/
   ```
   - Metadata file: `ms_raw_files.csv` (must include columns: `file_name`, `workflow`, `cohort`)
   - FASTA file: e.g., `uniprot_reference.fa`

3. **(Optional) Contamination panel**  
   If using contamination analysis, place the panel file in `data_input/`.

---

## Usage

We recommend running the pipeline in a **tmux** session for stability:

```bash
tmux
```

To run the full workflow and generate a QC report:

```bash
bash run_slurm.sh all
```

This will perform quantification, generate QC plots, and output a full PDF report.

### Running Individual Pipeline Steps

You can also run specific steps:

```bash
bash run_slurm.sh convert_all            # Data conversion only
bash run_slurm.sh A_all                  # Full quantification (DIANN or Spectronaut)
bash run_slurm.sh summarize_qc           # QC reports only
```

### Post-Quality Control Actions

**Apply batch correction:**  
Edit `config/config.yml` to enable batch correction and specify the batch column, then run:
```bash
bash run_slurm.sh summarize_qc
```

**Remove identified outlier samples:**  
Add sample IDs to `exclude_samples` in `config/config.yml`, then run:
```bash
bash run_slurm.sh remove_all_samples 
bash run_slurm.sh summarize_qc
```

## Pipeline Structure & Modes

The pipeline is **modular** and adapts to your configuration:

- **Quantification tool:**  
  Select between DIA-NN and Spectronaut via `quant_tool` in the config.

- **Run modes:**  
  - `"cohort"`: Quantifies each workflow/cohort combination separately.
  - `"workflow"`: Quantifies all cohorts pooled per workflow.
  - `"all"`: Quantifies all samples pooled together.

- **Automatic file handling:**  
  - Raw file types (e.g., `.raw`, `.d`) are inferred from your metadata.
  - Output files are always in the correct format for the selected tool.

- **Final marker files:**  
  - `data_output/A_all_diann_complete.marker` (for DIA-NN)
  - `data_output/S_all_spectronaut_complete.marker` (for Spectronaut)
  These indicate successful completion of the pipeline.

## Output

The pipeline generates:
- **Quantification results** (per run mode and tool)
- **Quality Control visualizations** (PNG)
- **Comprehensive individual PDF report**
- **Summary PDF report**

To download results:
```bash
scp -r user@server:/path/to/pipeline/data_output/ ~/local_directory/
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing required columns in metadata:**  
  Ensure your `ms_raw_files.csv` contains at least `file_name`, `workflow`, and `cohort`.

- **No FASTA file found:**  
  Place a single FASTA file in `data_input/`.

- **Pipeline fails on log file creation:**  
  All rules create log directories as needed; if you see errors, check directory permissions.

- **Not sure which run mode to use?**  
  - Use `"cohort"` for most studies (default).
  - Use `"workflow"` if you want to pool all cohorts per workflow.
  - Use `"all"` to pool all samples together.

## Overview

This pipeline provides an automated solution for **quantitative proteomics analysis** based on **Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry**. The workflow is designed to handle large cohorts and generate both **individual** and **summary quality control reports**.
